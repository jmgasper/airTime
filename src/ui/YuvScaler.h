/*!	Scales ten-bit 4:2:0 pictures (P010 from the hardware decoders,
	yuv420p10 from libavcodec) to the size they are shown at, a target row
	at a time, and gives each row's luma, Cb and Cr at full target width as
	sixteen-bit values (a ten-bit code times 64). What becomes of them -
	tone mapping, for the films that come this way - is the caller's.

	The filter is a triangle as wide as the scale factor: bilinear when
	enlarging, an average over the area each target pixel covers when
	shrinking. Chroma is placed where the stream says it was sampled.
	Rows are independent, so several threads can make them at once, each
	with its own Scratch.
